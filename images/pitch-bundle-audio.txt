33 women die every 100,000 live births.

What's alarming is that 84% of these deaths are preventable.

Why are mothers dying from causes we know how to prevent?

The reality is that too many mothers face barriers to proper care.

Many struggle to access reliable, timely information about their pregnancy, and factors like mobility, socioeconomic challenges, and geographic barriers make it difficult for some women to get the care they need.

Overwhelmed by life demands, many mothers miss critical check-ups, losing the chance to preventive care that could save their lives.

At the same time, healthcare providers are stretched thin.

Overloaded schedules, administrative burdens, and high patient volumes leave little room for personalized proactive care.

There's no alignment between them.

That's why we created BundleCare, a comprehensive healthcare platform designed to bridge the gaps in maternal healthcare.

With patient education and focused on preventive care, we empower mothers with the right information at the right time.

Our care management is tailored to personal needs, ensuring that no one is left behind, no matter their mobility, location, or unique challenges.

Bundle also aligns with providers and payers, promoting efficiency and risk sharing while ensuring predictable budgeting and cost control, leading to better outcomes for everyone.

Our approach includes routine tracking to help mothers stay on top of their care, care journey analysis, giving providers and mothers the insights they need for smarter decision making, patient advocacy, ensuring that every mother has a voice in their care, and ultimately, we improve outcomes, reducing preventable complications and saving lives.

At Bundle, we are transforming maternal healthcare because no mother should be left behind.
